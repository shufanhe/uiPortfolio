            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">PROBLEM</h3>
            <p>
                On our university campus, some elevators restrict access to certain floors using card authentication. While this improves safety, it introduces usability challenges: students unfamiliar with the system often attempt to press a floor button without swiping their ID card first, leading to confusion and delays. The current interface provides little guidance.
            </div>
          <div>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">SOLUTION</h3>
            <p>
                I conducted user research to identify friction points in the elevator experience, particularly for first-time users. The goal was to lay foundation for designing a clearer, more intuitive interface that maintains security while reducing confusion—especially in shared study or public access buildings like libraries.            </p>

            Below is a sketch of the current interface found in the library elevator. The card reader is placed apart from the call buttons, with no clear indication of the required interaction order.

            02 Conversation with Users:
        </h2>
        <p class="left-textp">I observed and interviewed three users while they were using the interface. 
            Based on the observations, users are generally familiar with the interface and have no trouble using it, but our conversations revealed some potential issues. 
            The following script is a summary of those interviews.</p>
        <div class="narrow">
            <img src="images/convo1.png" alt="Interviewer: Can you describe your first interaction with this interface? User: I was very confused, I didn’t know it required card access so I pressed and the elevator didn’t move. Another student in the elevator told me I had to swipe first.">
            <img src="images/convo2.png" alt="Interviewer: How often do you use this interface? User:A few times per week.">
            <img src="images/convo3.png" alt="Interviewer: How do you see other people interact with this interface? User: Most of the times I see people just press and it works. Also at this point people know which floors needs card access after what hours.">
            <img src="images/convo4.png" alt="Interviewer: What do you like/dislike about this interface? User: I like that it has labels of what each floor is for. But the card reader is located far away from the buttons with emergency stuff in between, so I didn’t think they were related at first. It’s also unclear which way you are supposed to swipe. But I guess it’s easy to learn, you remember after the first time.">
            <img src="images/convo5.png" alt="Interviewer: How would you describe your state of mind when you need to use this interface?  User: I’m usually in a rush, heading to a meeting or a class.">

            03 Personas:
        </h2>
        <p class="left-textp">
           Based on the above observations and converstions, we can roughly categorize the typical users into two archetypal personas. 
           Let's name them Sophie and Kevin, where Sophie is a new user while Kevin is a frequent user.

            04 User Story 
        </h2>
        <p class="left-textp">
            Now let's recreate Sophie's interaction with the interface as a new user through a short story.
        </p>
        <div class="narrow1">
            <img src="images/story.png" alt="storyboard: 1: Sophie is on her way to her first project meeting as a college Freshman. She enters the elevator and presses the button for the third floor. The button does not light up. 
            2: Sophie double checks her phone and sees that she is heading to the right place, and that she's running late.
            3: Sophie asks for help from another student in the elevator, who points to the card reader on the other side.
            4: Sophie sipes her ID.
            5: Sophie presses the button again, still no reaction. 
            6: She swipes again the other way.
            7: Sophie presses the button. This time it lights up.
            8: Sophie feels a little embarrasses about the encounter. The other student agrees that she didn't about the swipe access either.">

    <div class="section" id="section6">
        <h2 class="left-texth">05 Future Work </h2>
        <p class="left-textp">If the interface were to be redesigned, it would be helpful to place the card reader right next to the buttons. 
            For floors that are generally accessible to all but needs swipe access, a sign should be placed in the vincinity.</p>
