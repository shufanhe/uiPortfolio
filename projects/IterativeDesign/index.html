            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">PROBLEM</h3>
            <p>
              The app is popular among young working adults but lacks visibility among college students. The challenge is identifying a feature with strong virality potential on college campuses. Our goal is to increase adoption of the app among college students.           
              College students frequently host events, especially parties, and represent a large, untapped user base
            </p>
            </div>
          <div>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">SOLUTION</h3>
            <p>
              Introduce a potluck feature that allows event guests to contribute items and resources for events. Student-organized events typically have limited budgets and often rely on contributions from attendees. This functionality is not offered by major competitors like Eventbrite or Google Calendar.

      <h2 class="text-2xl">01 Sketching</h2>
      <p>Our first step of the iterative design process was to create sketches and wireframe to develop a low-fi prototype to center our design ideas.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl">My Sketches</h3>

            <li>Hosts can list what each guest will need for themselves in order to participate. (e.g., all guests need swimwear for beach event)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h4 class="text-2xl">Other Ideas from Teammates</h4>
          <ul>

          <h4 class="text-2xl">What's Incorporated From the Sketches</h4>

            <li>Guests can claim items and host can assign items.</li>

          <h4 class="text-2xl">New Additions During Wireframing</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Party Genie Templates:</strong> Pre-fill common items for quicker setup.</li>
            <li><strong>Save Template:</strong> Reuse item lists for recurring event types.</li>

      </div>
    
    
      <h4 class="text-2xl pt-12">Design Considerations</h4>
      <p>The challenge was balancing useful functionality with simplicity. We prioritized ease of use over advanced controls to keep the interface intuitive for student users.
        We left out a few ideas from the sketches because we thought they might be a little overwhelming and we wanted to prioritize the potluck idea. These include gamification, what each person needs to bring for themselves, and asking other guests for help.

            <li>
              Hosts should be able to edit or assign sign-ups, like with RSVPs,

              Rather than having users input quantities with unclear units (e.g., ‚Äú4
              chickens‚Äù), allow hosts to define the number of people needed per item

        Other than incorporating the design critiques, we took Caroline's suggestion to take a step back and dig deeper into the student mindset through user research. 
        I made and sent out flyers for a survey we wrote. The results showed that a lot of students simply haven‚Äôt heard of Partiful and don‚Äôt know what
        Partiful offers that other apps don‚Äôt.
